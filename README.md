**Quantize spacetime on your laptop.**

For an introduction to [Causal Dynamical Triangulations](https://github.com/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus/wiki), including the foundations and recent results, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus/wiki).

[Causal Dynamical Triangulations][1] in C++ using the
[Computational Geometry Algorithms Library][2] and [Eigen][25]>3.1.0, compiled
with [CMake][3] using [Clang][4]/[LLVM][5].
Arbitrary-precision numbers and functions by [MPFR][29] and [GMP][30].
Option-types via [Boost][47] >= 1.58.0.
[Docopt][19] provides a beautiful command-line interface.
[Gmock 1.7][6] may be optionally installed in order to build/run unit tests.
[Ninja][18] is a nice (but optional) replacement for `make`.
Intel's [TBB][37] provides significantly better performance if present (3x+).
Follows (mostly) the [Google C++ Style Guide][7] as enforced by [clang-format][46], which
you can check by downloading and running the [cpplint.py][8] script:

~~~
python cpplint.py <filename>
~~~

(Or use your favorite linter plugin for your editor/IDE.)

### Prerequisites ###
------

[CDT++][38] should build on any system (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Windows) with
[CMake][14], [CGAL][15], and [Eigen][25] installed. [TBB][37] provides an
optional (but significant) speed boost.  [Gmock][6] is optional
for running the unit tests, and [Ninja][18] is an optional replacement for
`make` which provides quick parallel builds of the unit tests.

On MacOS, the easiest way to do this is with [HomeBrew][16]:

~~~
brew install cmake
brew install eigen
brew install tbb --c++11
brew install ninja
brew install cgal --imaging --with-eigen3 --with-lapack
~~~

On Ubuntu, you will need an updated versions of gcc and [Boost][47], which you can install via:

~~~
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
# For Ubuntu 14.04
# sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:kzemek/boost
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++-6
export CXX="g++-6" CC="gcc-6"
~~~

Then you can install the rest of the needed libraries:

~~~
# For Ubuntu 16.04 which comes with Boost 1.58.0
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
# For Ubuntu 14.04
# sudo apt-get install boost1.58
sudo apt-get install libmpfr-dev
sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev
sudo apt-get install ninja-build
sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev
~~~

This is scripted in [.travis.yml][39].

### Build ###
------
This project uses a separate `build/` directory, which allows you to rebuild the
project without cluttering the source code. Thus, download this source code
(clone this repo from GitHub or grab a zipped archive [here][17]) and run the
following commands in the top-level directory:

~~~
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
~~~

(Or run [build.sh][27] if you have [Ninja][18] installed.)

This should result in the main program executable, `cdt` in the `build/`
directory.

If you have [GMock][6] installed and set `GMOCK_TESTS` to **TRUE** (which is the
default), the unit test executable, `unittests`, will also be present. See [Tests](#tests) for details.

If you are not interested in the unit tests and only want to run the program,
set `GMOCK_TESTS` in [CMakeLists.txt][28] to **FALSE**.

For some versions of Linux, you may have to build [CGAL][2] from source.
Follow the instructions (or their equivalent) given in the install section
of the [.travis.yml][39] buildfile.

There are enough unit tests that it's worthwhile doing fast parallel builds.
[Ninja][18] is just the ticket. It's effectively a drop-in replacement for
`make`, and works nicely because [CMake][3] generates the build files.
There's quite a difference in speed.

Basically, everywhere you see `make` you can type `ninja` instead. Again, see
[build.sh][27] for an example.

Possible build troubles:
-----------------------
* While running `build.sh` under linux with `gcc` you may encounter `virtual memory exhausted: Cannot allocate memory`, a common solution for which is to [allocate swap space](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-add-a-swap-file-howto/).

### Usage ###
------
CDT-plusplus uses [docopt][19] to parse options from the help message, and so
understands long or short argument formats, provided the short argument given
is an unambiguous match to a longer one. The help message should be instructive:

~~~
./build/cdt --help
Causal Dynamical Triangulations in C++ using CGAL.

Copyright (c) 2014-2016 Adam Getchell

A program that generates d-dimensional triangulated spacetimes
with a defined causal structure and evolves them according
to the Metropolis algorithm. Specify the number of passes to control
how much evolution is desired. Each pass attempts a number of ergodic
moves equal to the number of simplices in the simulation.

Usage:./cdt (--spherical | --toroidal) -n SIMPLICES -t TIMESLICES [-d DIM] -k K --alpha ALPHA --lambda LAMBDA [-p PASSES] [-c CHECKPOINT]

Examples:
./cdt --spherical -n 64000 -t 256 --alpha 1.1 -k 2.2 --lambda 3.3 --passes 1000
./cdt --s -n64000 -t256 -a1.1 -k2.2 -l3.3 -p1000

Options:
  -h --help                   Show this message
  --version                   Show program version
  -n SIMPLICES                Approximate number of simplices
  -t TIMESLICES               Number of timeslices
  -d DIM                      Dimensionality [default: 3]
  -a --alpha ALPHA            Negative squared geodesic length of 1-d
                              timelike edges
  -k K                        K = 1/(8*pi*G_newton)
  -l --lambda LAMBDA          K * Cosmological constant
  -p --passes PASSES          Number of passes [default: 100]
  -c --checkpoint CHECKPOINT  Checkpoint every n passes [default: 10]
~~~

The dimensionality of the spacetime is such that each slice of spacetime is
`d-1`-dimensional, so setting `d=3` generates 2 spacelike dimensions and one
timelike dimension, with a defined global time foliation. Thus a
`d`-dimensional simplex will have some `d-1` sub-simplices that are purely
spacelike (all on the same timeslice) as well as some that are timelike
(span two timeslices). In [CDT][1] we actually care more about the timelike
links (in 2+1 spacetime) and the timelike faces (in 3+1 spacetime).

### Documentation ###
--------------
Online documentation may be found at http://www.adamgetchell.org/CDT-plusplus/

If you have [Doxygen][13] installed you can generate the same information
locally by simply typing at the top level directory
([Doxygen][13] will recursively search):

~~~
doxygen
~~~

This will generate `html/` and `latex/` directories which will contain
documentation generated from CDT++ source files. `USE_MATHJAX` has been enabled
in [Doxyfile][41] so that the LaTeX formulae can be rendered in the html
documentation using [MathJax][20]. `HAVE_DOT` is set to **YES** which allows
various graphs to be autogenerated by [Doxygen][13] using [GraphViz][21].
If you do not have GraphViz installed, set this option to **NO**.

### Tests ###
-----------
[GMock][6] is optional, but strongly recommended if you want to make changes to
or understand the source code in detail. Building the [GMock][6] `unittests`
executable is set by the `GMOCK_TESTS` variable in [CMakeLists.txt][28].

To install GMock, you'll need to install GMock and GTest as a shared library. First look at the [README][24] to understand the general idea. On Linux:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
cd googletest/googlemock
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON .
make
sudo cp -a include/gmock/ /usr/include/
sudo cp -a libgmock_main.so libgmock.so /usr/lib/
~~~

GoogleMock is modular, and can use other testing frameworks. Since we want
to use GoogleTest, do:

~~~
cd ../googletest
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON .
make
sudo cp -a include/gtest /usr/include/
sudo cp -a libgtest_main.so libgtest.so /usr/lib/
~~~

This is scripted in [install-linux.sh][43]. Thanks to [ManuelSchneid3r][42] and
[Stack Overflow][40] for the assist.

MacOS is very similiar, and the exact steps are scripted in [install-osx.sh][44].


Unit tests using GMock are then run (in the `build/` directory) via:

~~~
./unittests
~~~

You can build and run validation tests by typing:

~~~
make test
~~~

Or, if you are using [Ninja][18]:

~~~
ninja test
~~~

In addition to the command line output, you can see detailed results in the
`build/Testing` directory which is generated thereby.

### Static Analysis ###
-----------
The [cppcheck-build.sh][35] script runs a quick static analysis using
[cppcheck][34].

[Clang][4] comes with [scan-build][32] which can run a much more thorough,
but slower static analysis integrated with [CMake][3] and [Ninja][18].
Simply run the [scan-build.sh][33] script. Note that this
script is somewhat fragile, as it depends upon the version of [llvm][5]
installed, and links directly to those directories without helpful symlinks
to abstract version numbers away.

Also, these tools build in **DEBUG** mode. You should probably not then run
`unittests` as you will get thousands of lines of debugging output from the
tests that create large triangulations. (You could use `--gtest_filter`
to run just the tests that you want.)
