**Quantize spacetime on your laptop.**

For an introduction to [Causal Dynamical Triangulations](https://github.com/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus/wiki), including the foundations and recent results, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus/wiki).

[Causal Dynamical Triangulations][CDT] in C++ using the
[Computational Geometry Algorithms Library][CGAL] and [Eigen]>3.1.0, compiled
with [CMake] using [Clang]/[LLVM].
Arbitrary-precision numbers and functions by [MPFR] and [GMP].
Option-types via [Boost] >= 1.64.0.
Uses [Docopt] to provide a beautiful command-line interface, and [Howard Hinnant's date and timezone][date] library for accurate time (both as [subrepos]).
[Catch] is included as a single header in order to build/run unit tests.
[Ninja] is a nice (but optional) replacement for `make`.
Intel's [TBB] provides significantly better performance if present (3x+).
Follows the [CppCore Guidelines][guidelines] as enforced by [clang-tidy], which you can run using the 
[clang-tidy.sh] script:

~~~
./clang-tidy.sh
~~~

(Or use your favorite linter plugin for your editor/IDE.)

## Prerequisites

[CDT++] should build on any system (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Windows) with
[CMake], [CGAL], [Boost], [MPFR], [Eigen], and [curl] installed. 
(Curl can be difficult on Windows, see [.appveyor.yml] for details.)
[TBB] provides an optional (but significant) speed boost.  [Catch] is 
optional (but recommended) for running the unit tests, and [Ninja] is an 
optional replacement for `make` which provides quick parallel builds of the 
unit tests.

On MacOS, the easiest way to do this is with [Homebrew]:

~~~
brew upgrade cmake
brew install ninja
brew upgrade boost
brew install eigen
brew install tbb --c++11
brew install cgal --imaging --with-eigen3 --with-lapack
~~~

On Ubuntu, you will need an updated versions of [Clang] or [gcc], 
[CMake], and [Boost], which is scripted in [.travis.yml].
With Howard Hinnant's [date] library, you may also need to install
`libcurl-dev`, which is a virtual package with many flavors, OpenSSL being
the most tried and tested.

## Build

This project uses a separate `build/` directory, which allows you to rebuild the
project without cluttering the source code. Thus, download this source code
(clone this repo from GitHub or grab a [release]) and run the following commands
in the top-level directory:

~~~
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DTESTS:BOOL=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build .
~~~

(Or run [build.sh] if you have [Ninja] installed.)

This should result in the main program executable, `cdt` in the `build/`
directory, along with several others.

* `cdt-gv` converts output files to GeomView format for visualization
* `cdt-opt` is a simplified version with hard-coded inputs, mainly useful for 
debugging and scripting

If you build [Catch] unit tests (`-DTESTS:BOOL=ON`), the executable
`/test/CDT_test` will also be present. See [Tests](#Tests) for details.

For some versions of Linux, you may have to build [CGAL] from source.
Follow the instructions (or their equivalent) given in the install section
of the [.travis.yml] build file.

There are enough unit tests that it's worthwhile doing fast parallel builds.
[Ninja] is just the ticket. It's effectively a drop-in replacement for
`make`, and works nicely because [CMake] generates the build files.
There's quite a difference in speed. CMake also abstracts away the build
tool nicely. Again, see [build.sh] for an example.

## Usage

CDT-plusplus uses [Docopt] to parse options from the help message, and so
understands long or short argument formats, provided the short argument given
is an unambiguous match to a longer one. The help message should be instructive:

~~~
./build/cdt --help
Causal Dynamical Triangulations in C++ using CGAL.

Copyright (c) 2014-2017 Adam Getchell

A program that generates d-dimensional triangulated spacetimes
with a defined causal structure and evolves them according
to the Metropolis algorithm. Specify the number of passes to control
how much evolution is desired. Each pass attempts a number of ergodic
moves equal to the number of simplices in the simulation.

Usage:./cdt (--spherical | --toroidal) -n SIMPLICES -t TIMESLICES [-d DIM] -k K --alpha ALPHA --lambda LAMBDA [-p PASSES] [-c CHECKPOINT]

Examples:
./cdt --spherical -n 64000 -t 256 --alpha 0.6 -k 1.1 --lambda 0.1 --passes 1000
./cdt --s -n64000 -t256 -a.6 -k1.1 -l.1 -p1000

Options:
  -h --help                   Show this message
  --version                   Show program version
  -n SIMPLICES                Approximate number of simplices
  -t TIMESLICES               Number of timeslices
  -d DIM                      Dimensionality [default: 3]
  -a --alpha ALPHA            Negative squared geodesic length of 1-d
                              timelike edges
  -k K                        K = 1/(8*pi*G_newton)
  -l --lambda LAMBDA          K * Cosmological constant
  -p --passes PASSES          Number of passes [default: 100]
  -c --checkpoint CHECKPOINT  Checkpoint every n passes [default: 10]
~~~

The dimensionality of the spacetime is such that each slice of spacetime is
`d-1`-dimensional, so setting `d=3` generates 2 spacelike dimensions and one
timelike dimension, with a defined global time foliation. Thus a
`d`-dimensional simplex will have some `d-1` sub-simplices that are purely
spacelike (all on the same timeslice) as well as some that are timelike
(span two timeslices). In [CDT] we actually care more about the timelike
links (in 2+1 spacetime) and the timelike faces (in 3+1 spacetime).

## Documentation

Online documentation may be found at http://www.adamgetchell.org/CDT-plusplus/

If you have [Doxygen] installed you can generate the same information
locally by simply typing at the top level directory
([Doxygen] will recursively search):

~~~
doxygen
~~~

This will generate the `html/` directory which will contain
documentation generated from CDT++ source files. `USE_MATHJAX` has been enabled
in [Doxyfile] so that the LaTeX formulae can be rendered in the html
documentation using [MathJax]. `HAVE_DOT` is set to **YES** which allows
various graphs to be autogenerated by [Doxygen] using [GraphViz].
If you do not have GraphViz installed, set this option to **NO**
(along with `UML_LOOK`).

## Tests

[Catch] is optional, but strongly recommended if you want to make changes to
or understand the source code in detail. It's easily deployable as a [single
header file][catch-header] obtained from GitHub. Building the [Catch] `CDT_test`
executable is set by the `TESTS` variable in [CMakeLists.txt], or
at the command line (first `cd` into `build`) using:

~~~
cmake -DTESTS:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
~~~

Unit tests using Catch are then run (in the `build/test` directory) via:

~~~
./CDT_test
~~~

You can also run both [CTest] and [Catch] via:

~~~
cmake --build . --target test
~~~

In addition to the command line output, you can see detailed results in the
`build/Testing` directory which is generated thereby.

## Static Analysis

The [cppcheck-build.sh] script runs a quick static analysis using
[cppcheck].

[Clang] comes with [scan-build] which can run a much more thorough,
but slower static analysis integrated with [CMake] and [Ninja].
Simply run the [scan.sh] script.

One of the [Travis-CI] jobs runs [Valgrind][valgrind]; be sure to look at the 
results to ensure you're not leaking memory.
