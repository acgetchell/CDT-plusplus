For an introduction to [Causal Dynamical Triangulations](https://github.com/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus/wiki),
including the foundations and recent results, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus/wiki).

[Causal Dynamical Triangulations][CDT] in [C++] use the
[Computational Geometry Algorithms Library][CGAL], [Boost], [TBB], and [Eigen].
Arbitrary-precision numbers and functions via [MPFR] and [GMP].
Uses [Docopt] to provide a beautiful command-line interface, and [Howard Hinnant's date and timezone][date]
library for accurate time.
Uses [Melissa E. O'Neill's Permuted Congruential Generators][PCG] library for high-quality RNGs that pass L'Ecuyer's
[TestU01] statistical tests.
Uses [Catch] for [BDD]/[TDD].
Uses [Conan]/[CMake]/[Ninja] for dependency management and building.
Uses [Doxygen] for automated document generation.

## Getting Started

If you just want to run a stable version of the code, grab a versioned [release].

Otherwise, you can clone the repo, including submodules, as follows:

~~~
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus.git
~~~

(Older versions of `git` may require `--recursive` instead of `--recurse-submodules`.)

This will put you on the [development] branch. Project layout
is the [PitchFork Layout], as follows:

- .github - GitHub specific settings
- build - Ephemeral build directory
- docs - Documentation
- external - Includes external projects, e.g. [PCG]
- include - Header files
- src - Source files
- tests - Unit tests
- tools - Build, test, and run scripts

### Prerequisites

- AppleClang, [clang-7], or [gcc-8]
- [Homebrew] or [Linuxbrew]
- [Conan]
- [CMake]
- [Ninja]
- [CGAL]
- [TBB]

[CDT++] uses the [Conan] open source C/C++ package manager. However, [Conan] does not have a package for [CGAL],
and does not handle [TBB] properly. So, you need [Homebrew]/[Linuxbrew].

MacOS:

~~~bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
~~~

Linux (Ubuntu):

~~~bash
sudo apt install linuxbrew-wrapper
PATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
echo 'export PATH="/home/travis/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
brew --version
export MANPATH="$(brew --prefix)/share/man:$MANPATH"
export INFOPATH="$(brew --prefix)/share/info:$INFOPATH"
brew doctor
brew config
~~~

Then, you can install the prerequisites with:

~~~bash
brew update
brew upgrade cmake
brew install ninja
brew install tbb
brew install cgal
~~~

Homebrew/Linuxbrew [have been merged] and no longer support options, so the [CGAL] package dependency
on [Qt] fails. As of now, you have to manually install [CGAL]+[Qt] to get the (forthcoming)
visualizations to work.

Finally, you can install conan:

~~~bash
brew install conan
~~~

You can test your Conan installation by typing:

~~~bash
conan
~~~

Next, create a [Conan] profile (named `cdt` here) automatically, using:

~~~bash
conan profile new cdt --detect
~~~

This (usually) finds your compiler settings, and allows the [build.sh] script to run correctly.

There are a few packages that use the [bincrafters] repository. Add that via:

~~~bash
conan remote add bincrafters https://api.bintray.com/conan/bincrafters/public-conan
~~~

Using [CMake] and [Ninja], Conan handles the remaining dependencies.

This project uses [C++]17 features, and successfully builds with AppleClang, [gcc-8], and [clang-7].
On Ubuntu, you may need updated versions of [Clang] or [gcc], and [CMake], which is scripted in [.travis.yml].

Windows is almost there with [clang-cl], there is a [bug] with [date].

### Installing

This project uses a separate `build/` directory, which allows you to rebuild the
project without cluttering the source code. Thus, download this source code
(clone this repo from GitHub or grab a [release]) and run the [build.sh] script.

This should result in the main program executable, `cdt` in the `build/bin`
directory, along with several others.

- `CDT_test` is the [Catch] executable which runs the unit tests
- `cdt-gv` converts output files to [Geomview] format for visualization
- `cdt-opt` is a simplified version with hard-coded inputs, mainly useful for
debugging and scripting
- `initialize` is used by [CometML] to run [parameter optimization](#parameter-optimization)

The install script will also run unit and integration tests.
See [Testing](#testing) for details.

### Usage

CDT-plusplus uses [Docopt] to parse options from the help message, and so
understands long or short argument formats, provided the short argument given
is an unambiguous match to a longer one. The help message should be instructive:

~~~text
./build/cdt --help
Causal Dynamical Triangulations in C++ using CGAL.

Copyright (c) 2014-2019 Adam Getchell

A program that generates d-dimensional triangulated spacetimes
with a defined causal structure and evolves them according
to the Metropolis algorithm. Specify the number of passes to control
how much evolution is desired. Each pass attempts a number of ergodic
moves equal to the number of simplices in the simulation.

Usage:./cdt (--spherical | --toroidal) -n SIMPLICES -t TIMESLICES [-d DIM] -k K --alpha ALPHA --lambda LAMBDA [-p PASSES] [-c CHECKPOINT]

Examples:
./cdt --spherical -n 32000 -t 11 --alpha 0.6 -k 1.1 --lambda 0.1 --passes 1000
./cdt --s -n32000 -t11 -a.6 -k1.1 -l.1 -p1000

Options:
  -h --help                   Show this message
  --version                   Show program version
  -n SIMPLICES                Approximate number of simplices
  -t TIMESLICES               Number of timeslices
  -d DIM                      Dimensionality [default: 3]
  -a --alpha ALPHA            Negative squared geodesic length of 1-d
                              timelike edges
  -k K                        K = 1/(8*pi*G_newton)
  -l --lambda LAMBDA          K * Cosmological constant
  -p --passes PASSES          Number of passes [default: 100]
  -c --checkpoint CHECKPOINT  Checkpoint every n passes [default: 10]
~~~

The dimensionality of the spacetime is such that each slice of spacetime is
`d-1`-dimensional, so setting `d=3` generates 2 spacelike dimensions and one
timelike dimension, with a defined global time foliation. Thus a
`d`-dimensional simplex will have some `d-1` sub-simplices that are purely
spacelike (all on the same timeslice) as well as some that are timelike
(span two timeslices). In [CDT] we actually care more about the timelike
links (in 2+1 spacetime) and the timelike faces (in 3+1 spacetime).

## Documentation

Online documentation may be found at <http://www.adamgetchell.org/CDT-plusplus/>

If you have [Doxygen] installed you can generate the same information
locally by simply typing at the top level directory
([Doxygen] will recursively search):

~~~bash
doxygen
~~~

This will generate the `html/` directory which will contain
documentation generated from CDT++ source files. `USE_MATHJAX` has been enabled
in [Doxyfile] so that the LaTeX formulae can be rendered in the html
documentation using [MathJax]. `HAVE_DOT` is set to **YES** which allows
various graphs to be autogenerated by [Doxygen] using [GraphViz].
If you do not have GraphViz installed, set this option to **NO**
(along with `UML_LOOK`).

## Testing

Unit tests using [Catch] are run (in the `build/bin` directory) via:

~~~bash
./CDT_test
~~~

You can also run both [CTest] integration and [Catch] unit tests in the `build` directory with:

~~~bash
ctest
~~~

In addition to the command line output, you can see detailed results in the
`build/Testing` directory which is generated thereby.

Whitespace formatting is can be checked using `git check`:

~~~bash
git diff --check HEAD^
~~~

### Static Analysis

This project follows the [CppCore Guidelines][guidelines] as enforced by [ClangTidy], which you can check using the
[clang-tidy.sh] script:

~~~bash
./clang-tidy.sh
~~~

(Or use your favorite linter plugin for your editor/IDE.)

The [cppcheck-build.sh] script runs a quick static analysis using [cppcheck].

~~~bash
./cppcheck-build.sh
~~~

[Clang] comes with [scan-build] which can run a much more thorough,
but slower static analysis integrated with [CMake] and [Ninja].

~~~bash
./scan.sh
~~~

### Continuous Integration

- [ClangTidy] on all changed files

- Whitespace formatting

- [Valgrind]; be sure to look at the results to ensure you're not leaking memory

- [SonarCloud], also worth a look

## Parameter Optimization

[CometML] is used to record [Experiments] which conduct [Model Optimization]. The script to do
this is `optimize-initialize.py`. In order for this to work, you must install the following
into your Python [virtual environment].

~~~bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install comet-ml
~~~

You can then run experiments and look at results on Comet.ml!
